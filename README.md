Washoff
======

This code simulates the loss of  pesticides  sprayed on leaves by rainfall. The model is based  the detachment of a quantity of pesticide by a single raindrop hit.
Accumulation of randomly distributed raindrop impacts on the canopy is a Point Poisson process.

The timecourse os pesicide losses during a rainfall event can be derived in this way.

This model was calibrated with experimantal data in several surfaces.
